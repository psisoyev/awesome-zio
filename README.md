[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aparo/awesome-zio/master/awesome-zio.png)](https://github.com/aparo/awesome-zio)

A community driven list of useful ZIO libraries, frameworks and software.  Inspired by [awesome-python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python). Other amazingly awesome lists can be found in the [awesome-awesomeness](https://github.com/bayandin/awesome-awesomeness) list.

Projects with over 500 stargazers are in bold.

Based partial on ZIO documentation.
